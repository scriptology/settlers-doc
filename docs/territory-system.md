# Territory System

## Overview

The territory system in SETTLERS is built around hexagonal hexes that represent real-world locations. The game features three distinct map levels, each serving its own strategic purpose.

## Map Levels

### Personal Territory Level

- Shows individual hexes that players can capture
- Each hex covers about <span style="color: #2962FF">15,000</span> square meters
- The distance between opposite corners is about <span style="color: #2962FF">150</span> meters
- This is where direct territory capture happens
- Players can capture hexes from anyone, including clanmates

### Clan Territory Level

- Shows larger clan-controlled regions
- Each clan hex covers about <span style="color: #2962FF">737,000</span> square meters (roughly 49 personal hexes)
- Control is calculated based on personal hexes within the area
- Visualizes clan dominance in different regions
- Clan wars happen at this level
- Perfect for strategic clan planning

### Global Overview Level

- Displays worldwide territory distribution
- Shows total captured territories across the globe
- Helps track global clan presence
- Perfect for understanding the game's global scale

## Understanding Personal Hexes

### Global Scale

The world in SETTLERS is divided into approximately <span style="color: #2962FF">34 billion</span> unique hexes! This means:
- Every location on Earth is part of some hex
- Each city has thousands of hexes to conquer
- There's always new territory to discover and claim
- You'll never run out of new areas to explore

### Size and Scale

Each hex in SETTLERS represents a carefully designed territory that's perfect for local gameplay:

- **Area**: Each hex covers about <span style="color: #2962FF">15,000</span> square meters (roughly the size of three football fields)
- **Walking Distance**: The distance between opposite corners is about <span style="color: #2962FF">150</span> meters
- **Practical Size**: 
  - Small enough to capture quickly
  - Large enough to create meaningful territories
  - Perfect for neighborhood-level gameplay
  - Ideal for short walking distances between hexes

This size was chosen to make the game enjoyable and accessible:
- You can capture several hexes during a short walk
- Territories feel substantial but not overwhelming
- Multiple hexes can be controlled in your local area
- Strategic movement between hexes is convenient

## Hex States

- **Unclaimed**: No current owner
- **Claimed**: Has an active owner
- **Cooldown**: Recently captured and temporarily locked

## Capturing Mechanics

### Requirements

1. Physical presence in the hex
2. No active cooldown period
3. Valid location verification

### Capture Process

1. Player must be physically present in the hex
2. If successful:
   - Player becomes the new owner
   - Cooldown period begins
   - Previous owner (if any) is notified
   - If you're in a clan, the hex remains under clan control

### Cooldown System

- Each hex has a 1-hour cooldown after capture
- During cooldown:
  - Hex cannot be captured by other players
- Cooldown helps prevent constant territory flipping
- Encourages strategic timing of captures

## Territory Control

### Clan Dynamics

- Members of the same clan can capture hexes from each other
- When a clan member captures a hex from another clan member:
  - The individual owner changes
  - The hex remains under the clan's control
  - The clan's territory stays intact
- This encourages active participation within clans

### Notifications

- Players receive notifications when:
  - Their hexes are captured
  - Nearby hexes become available
  - Important territory events occur

## Strategic Elements

1. **Connected Hexes**

   - Building continuous territories
   - Creating defensive barriers
   - Establishing supply lines

2. **Strategic Locations**

   - Landmarks and points of interest
