# Clan System

## Overview

The clan system in SETTLERS allows players to form organized groups to control larger territories and compete together. Clans provide a social and strategic layer to the game, enabling players to work together towards common goals.

For detailed information about clan territories and how they are calculated, see [Territory System - Clan Territory Layer](territory-system.md#clan-territory-layer).

## Joining a Clan

Two ways to join:

1. **Invitation Link**
   - Each clan member can generate invite links
   - Joining through link makes you a referral of inviter
   - Helps both players through referral program

2. **Direct Join**
   - Click any hex owned by clan
   - Press "Join" button in clan details
   - No referral benefits

After joining, all your hexes become part of clan territory

## Leaving a Clan

2. When leaving:
   - Your hexes will no longer show clan ownership
