# Clan System

## Overview

The clan system in SETTLERS allows players to form organized groups to control larger territories and compete together. Clans provide a social and strategic layer to the game, enabling players to work together towards common goals.

## Territory Control

### Individual Hexes

- All hexes captured by clan members contribute to clan territory
- Members can capture hexes from other clan members
- When capturing from other clans:
  - The hex transfers to your clan's control
  - Contributes to clan territory calculation

### Clan Territory Visualization

- Clan territories are shown on a dedicated map layer
- Each clan hex represents a larger area (about <span style="color: #2962FF">737,000</span> square meters)
- Clan hex control is determined by:
  - Number of personal hexes owned within the area
  - Distribution of hexes among different clans
- This creates strategic depth for clan warfare
- Helps identify strongholds and expansion opportunities

## Clan Features

### Creation and Management

- Any player can create a new clan
- Each clan has a designated leader
- Players can only be a member of one clan at a time
- Clans can have multiple members

### Leadership

- Clan leaders have special privileges:
  - Can update clan information
  - Manage clan members
  - Set clan strategies and goals
- If a leader leaves, the most active player (based on total settlements) becomes the new leader

### Territory Control

- All hexes captured by clan members contribute to clan territory
- When a member captures a hex, it's marked with both player and clan ownership
- Clan territories are visible on the map
- Members can see all hexes controlled by their clanmates

## Joining a Clan

### Process

1. Find a clan you want to join
2. Submit a join request
3. Once accepted, you become a clan member
4. Your existing hexes will be marked with clan ownership

## Leaving a Clan

### Process

1. You can leave a clan at any time
2. When leaving:
   - Your hexes will no longer show clan ownership
   - You'll lose access to clan benefits
   - If you're the last member, the clan will be dissolved

### Special Cases

- If the leader leaves:
  - The most active remaining member becomes the new leader
  - This is determined by the total number of hexes settled
- If all members leave:
  - The clan is automatically dissolved
  - All clan markings are removed from hexes
