## Settlement Process

1. Move to the hex you want to capture
2. Press the "Settle" button to capture it
3. After settlement:
   - You become the hex owner
   - If you're in a clan, hex becomes clan territory
   - Hex gets 1-hour immunity from capture
   - Previous owner (if any) loses the hex

## Capture Requirements

To capture a hex, you need:

1. Physical presence in the hex
2. Press the "Settle" button to capture

## Capture Mechanics



### Capture Process

1. **Initiation**
   - Player must be physically present in the hex
   - Player must trigger capture action in the game

2. **Successful Capture**
   - Player becomes the new owner
   - Cooldown period begins
   - Previous owner (if any) is notified
   - Territory statistics update

### Clan Capture Dynamics

- Members of the same clan can capture hexes from each other
- When a clan member captures a hex from another clan member:
  - The individual owner changes
  - The hex remains under the clan's control
  - The clan's territory stays intact
- This system encourages active participation within clans

## Cooldown System

### Basic Rules

- Each hex enters a 1-hour cooldown period after capture
- During cooldown:
  - Hex cannot be captured by other players
  - Timer is visible to all players
  - Owner is protected from immediate recapture

### Strategic Importance

- Prevents constant territory flipping
- Encourages strategic timing of captures
- Allows players to maintain territory control
- Creates natural breaks in territory wars

## Notifications

Players receive notifications for important events:

- When their hexes are captured
- When nearby hexes become available
- When cooldown periods expire
- For important territory events

## Territory Building Strategy

### Connected Territories

- Building continuous territories is advantageous
- Connected hexes create stronger defensive positions
- Supply lines can be established through connected hexes
- Easier to monitor and defend connected areas

### Defense Tactics

- Monitor cooldown timers of your hexes
- Maintain regular presence in your territory
- Coordinate with clan members for defense
- Use natural barriers and strategic locations

## Fair Play Systems

To ensure fair gameplay, the system includes:

- Location verification checks
- Movement speed monitoring
- Anti-spoofing protection
- Activity pattern analysis

Players should always:
- Play from their actual physical location
- Move at realistic speeds between hexes
- Respect game mechanics and other players
- Report any suspicious activity
